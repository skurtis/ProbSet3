## Calculating Summary Statistics Using Python
Implementing Question1.py calculates the maximum water level and the date and time at which it was observed (see CSV file) using standard Python commands:
```
python3 Question1.py
```
Running Question3.py calculates the maximum increase in water level and the date and time at which it was observed:
```
python3 Question3.py
```
## Calculating Summary Statistics using Pandas
Implementing Question2.py calculates the maximum water level and the date and time at which it was observed by importing the CSV file as a data frame and calculating the maximum using pandas.
```
python3 Question2.py
```
